    "reasoning": "Based on the requirements, the data structure focuses on storing contact form entries securely and enabling potential future extensions such as user-specific data or client dashboards. Since there are no roles, we do not need to store roles in the database. Each submission is stored in a flat collection with a timestamp. \n\n**Authorization Independence:** The structure does not rely on hierarchical authorization. Contact form entries are submitted anonymously and stored directly, and, therefore do not require dependency on parent documents.\n\n**QAPs:** The flat collection structure `contact_form_entries` supports list operations. Security rules will ensure only authenticated admins can read the collection while anyone can create a new entry.\n\n**Justification of Paths:**\n*   `/contact_form_entries`: This is the main collection for storing contact form submissions. Each document contains the data submitted through the contact form."
