/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Contact Form Entries.
 * @description This ruleset allows anyone to create a contact form entry, but restricts reading, updating, and deleting entries to authenticated users.
 * @dataStructure All contact form entries are stored in a flat collection at `/contact_form_entries/{contactFormEntryId}`.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - Anyone can create a contact form entry (Public Read with Owner-Only Writes pattern, but 'owner' is the app, not the user).
 *   - Only authenticated users (e.g., admins) can read, update, or delete contact form entries.
 *   - User listing is not supported for contact form entries.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization N/A - No user-specific ownership.
 * @structuralSegregation N/A - No private vs. public data. All entries are treated the same.
